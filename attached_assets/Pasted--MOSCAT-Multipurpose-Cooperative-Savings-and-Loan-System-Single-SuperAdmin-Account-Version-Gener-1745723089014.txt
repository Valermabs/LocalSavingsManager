o	Specify Effective Date (no retroactive changes).
o	Provide Reason for interest rate change.
o	Set Minimum Balance to qualify for interest.
o	Set Computation Basis:
	"Daily" = (Annual Rate ÷ 365)
	"Monthly" = (Annual Rate ÷ 12)
•	Interest earnings should be recorded separately, not added to principal.

•	Loan Application Form includes:
o	Loan Type
o	Loan Amount
o	Interest Rate (auto-fetched)

CopyEdit
principal = total loan amount
interest_rate = annual interest rate (%)
term_years = number of years

annual_principal_payment = principal / term_years

for each year:
  remaining_principal = starting_principal - (annual_principal_payment × (completed years))
  annual_interest = remaining_principal × (interest_rate / 100)
  monthly_amortization = (annual_interest / 12) + (annual_principal_payment / 12)
________________________________________
Reports Generation:
•	SuperAdmin can generate:
o	Individual Member Reports (all transactions, interest earned, loan details).
o	Dormancy Reports.
o	Transaction Journals (Monthly Summaries).
________________________________________
System Must:
•	Validate all numeric fields.
•	Ensure all core features (login, registration, transactions, loans, reports) are fully operational.
